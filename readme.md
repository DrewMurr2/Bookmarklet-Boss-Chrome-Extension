One example of why I created this: 
###
There is one particular webpage I visit that displays 100 contacts at a time and DOES NOT have a select all button! As infuriating as this is, with Bookmarklet boss I can write a tiny bit of javascript which selects all check boxes on the page. Now when I open the page I just use Bookmarklet Boss to run the tiny Bookmarklet I created for this purpose. 

###
I am sure that if you like to write code like I do, you will find many uses for your Bookmarklets!
